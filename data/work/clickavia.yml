  announce: Comfortable service to find and buy airline tickets, <br/> running on modern platform
  description: |
    Clickavia provides 
    __comfortable service to find and buy airline tickets__.
    These great folks asked to analyze existing codebase and refactor some modules to rise code quality level at first.
    Later they offered us to develop mobile applications so their customers could search and buy tickets everywhere they go.
    That work included separate
    __server-side API__
    and iPhone/iPad applications (now in alpha).
  features:
    1: Code review
    2: Refactoring (ruby)
    3: Backend separation
    4: Server-side API
    5: iOS development
  technologies:
    1: Ruby
    2: Objective-C
  methodologies:
    1: Rapid prototyping
    2: Scrum

      title: Behind the shiny interface

        In 2013 we were asked by Clickavia CTO Pavel Bubentsov to review project architecture and code.
        The company was running quite well while there were some technical problems about its futher development and extension.
        We checked metrics and took a look at architecture: the codebase needed some optimization.
        <br><br>
        We reconsidered the system with Domain–driven design approach and GRASP/SOLID principles.
        Then made refactoring, separated the project into two applications so the code became much cleaner and easy to understand.
        This essentially accelerated and simplified overall project development.
        Codeclimate GPA was improved from 1.8 to 3.0.

        Travel industry is growing really fast and many companies already offer ordering tickets via smartphone or tablet.
        So it was quite logical decision for Clickavia to create iPhone and iPad apps. As we use lean approach we created
        clickable lo-fi prototypes that helped us to define project objectives on the first stage.

        While the wireframes were being tested and refined we also developed a working prototype which allowed us to test network latency
        and other real-life circumstances. So when we finished prototyping stage we had both wireframes and working examples of how our apps will
        communicate with server-side API. This stage also allowed us to break the whole app into different modules, write specs for them
        and improve API documentation.

        At the same time we created high-fidelity mockups based on wireframes.
        User experience design and server-side API were synced in their terms and both shaped each other.
        We came to this when we were refining wireframes, and it helped us to make decisions faster in further development and design, create better
        design specifications and API documentation.

        This project is an example of how technologies help a company to improve customer experience and succeed in business goals.
        The prettiest point in software projects is that you can test and refine your processes before applying them in real life.
        We take that advantage and organize our work to deliver, get feedback and improve the product as soon as possible.
