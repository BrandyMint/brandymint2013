      We were involved in this project when it was popular source of market news and analytics.
      The project was growing fast and needed to become scalable and reliable.
      Originally it based on Bitrix CMS and our mission was to develop new platform with bucket of additional features.
      We chose Ruby on Rails and carefully took existing database to the new environment.
      Development included full redesign with responsive design approach.
